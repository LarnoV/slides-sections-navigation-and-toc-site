<h1>Privacy Policy — Sections &amp; TOC for Google Slides</h1>
<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-08-14</p>
We explain what data the Add-on processes, why, and your choices.

1. Who we are

Controller/Provider: Larno Visser, larnotue@gmail.com.

2. What the Add-on does

The Add-on helps organize Google Slides decks into sections, generate a Table of Contents, and navigate slides.

3. Data we process

Google account email (read via Apps Script) to personalize the experience and, if enabled, check license status.

Presentation content inside the active Slides file: slide titles, layouts, speaker notes, slide IDs, and thumbnails generated via the Google Slides API.

Settings stored in the presentation’s document properties (e.g., selected mode).

Diagnostics: client-side error messages shown to you; we do not collect analytics unless you opt in.

We do not copy your slides’ content to our servers unless you enable a paid license check (see §6).

4. Permissions and scope

The Add-on requests:

presentations / presentations.readonly to read and write slides and notes,

drive.file to work on the current file,

script.container.ui to show the sidebar,

userinfo.email to know which user is running the Add-on.

5. How we use data

Create/update a Table of Contents, read/write speaker notes for section tags, and render slide thumbnails.

Store per-file settings in document properties so your choices persist.

6. Payments / licensing

If you opt into a paid plan, the Add-on may call our license endpoint with your email to verify entitlement. We store email, plan, and expiry for licensing only. No slide content is sent to us. Payments are processed by Stripe, Inc., a third‑party payment processor. During a transaction, Stripe collects transaction-related data—such as name, email, billing address, and payment method details—and may share it with financial partners and fraud‑prevention services to authenticate and authorize payments. We (the Add‑on provider) do not have access to full card numbers (PANs) or CVV details. Stripe processes personal data as both a data controller and data processor under its Privacy Policy and Data Processing Agreement, and engages subprocessors governed by strict contracts and EU‑US (and other) transfer frameworks to ensure data security and regulatory compliance..

7. Retention

We don’t retain your slide content.

License records are kept while your subscription is active and for up to 24 months after expiry (for audit and fraud prevention).

8. Security

We rely on Google’s security for Apps Script execution and the Slides API. Any server-side endpoints use HTTPS and access controls.

9. Your rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or export your data. Contact larnotue@gmail.com.

10. Children

The Add-on is not directed to children under 16.

11. Changes

We’ll update this policy as needed and note a new effective date.
